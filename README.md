To implement the required application, the following steps must be completed:

(Start server)
1. Pull the repository using the command
```
git clone https://github.com/Rompey/blog.git
```
2. Go to the project folder on Desktop (filePath)
```
cd ./filePath
```
3. This project is written in gradle, so we run it using the command
(clear the cache, then build)
```
./gradlew clean build
```
4. The application works with Spring Boot, so we use the command
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

(Launch UI)
5.While in the project folder, go to the folder with UI
```
.cd /demo2-app
```
6. After that we launch our UI
```
npm start
```
Ready.
